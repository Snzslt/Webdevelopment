Hello Alex 
I tried to open Omnivox but it seems that it has a trouble.
so i will send you a url of my file.
I hope you are doing well.
i just wanted to say a bit of explanation about my project. you have to start with the home.html the page created responsive with Bootstrap and the button "click for fun" and "login" works .
it was my plan to do the hole project but the lack of time didn't allowed me , form the button login you will go to login page and can login and do the javascript and form there ...
Thanks for every thing and your class .You are full of energy please stay like this for your hole life.I learn too much from you:)
Regards
Zahra
